We have just launched a **PHP package for OhMySMTP.com**

You can now **send emails from a PHP app (including Laravel, Smyfony etc.) with OhMySMTP.com!**

The package is available for installation via Composer from Packagist here: https://packagist.org/packages/ohmysmtp/ohmysmtp-swiftmailer and the setup instructions and source code are here: https://github.com/ohmysmtp/ohmysmtp-swiftmailer

If you don't have an OMS account, get one set up today: https://app.ohmysmtp.com/users/sign_up

Happy sending!
