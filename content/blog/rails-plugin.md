We've just launched our **first application framework plugin for OhMySMTP.com**

You can now **send emails from a Ruby-on-Rails app with OhMySMTP.com!**

The gem is available on rubygems here: https://rubygems.org/gems/ohmysmtp-rails 

and the setup instructions and source code are here: https://github.com/ohmysmtp/ohmysmtp-rails

If you don't have an OMS account, get one set up today: https://app.ohmysmtp.com/users/sign_up

Happy sending!
